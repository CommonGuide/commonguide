# Proposal: Can we Agree to Adopt the Common Guide? 

## **Introduction**

This proposal is for {{ config.site_name }} to: 

1. adopt the Common Guide process updating our governance agreements; and 
2. consent to abide be the set of baseline agreements Common Guide contributors with each other (see [insert list of agreements])

## **Discussion prompts:**

Before deciding on this proposal, it is important to discuss the advantages and disadvantages associated with the Common Guide. To start discussion, please consider the following prompts:

 * How will using the Common Guide support us to adopt and maintain agreements better then we currently do? 
 * For each agreement, consider if and how it offers a useful guideline for how to interact with other contributors to the Common Guide
 * Taken together, do these set of agreements align with how we want to participate in governance practices.   

## **Potential decision outcomes:**

1.  Adopting the Common Guide process updating our governance agreements and consenting to abide be the set of baseline agreements guiding how Common Guide contributors interact with each other (so you can then use and contribute to the Common Guide).
    
3.  Adopting the Common Guide process updating our governance agreements yet NOT consenting to abide be the set of baseline agreements guiding how Common Guide contributors interact with each other (so, while you may use the Common Guide, you will not be able to act as contributors)
    
4. NOT adopting the Common Guide or consenting to the baseline Common Guide agreements (in which case, encourage you to develop your own governance practices)
