# Emergent Mutual-aid Crew Starter Agreements

This starter set of agreements is intended for groups cultivating mutual aid practices that are keen to leverage 'cutting edge' emergent people practices in ways that allow highly agile decision-making that is filled with care. Examples groups include, the Diverse Wellbeing Collective (DWC) and Digital Justice Society

These agreements assume that the group:

 * Is initially formed by a small crew (2-10 people) with ambitions to cultivate a larger group of community participants (~50 people)
 * Wants to make fast, agile decisions together and willing to implement well-established governance policies and review periodically
 * Has no plans to become a registered non-profit
 * Limited need to handle funds
