# Common Guide Contributor Agreements

This set of agreements provides a baseline protocol that guides how we interact with each other within the context of the Common Guide processes. 

Currently still in development, examples of agreements we expect to include here are a contributors code of conduct and a process for navigating conflict well.

Friendly contributions are welcome at the Common Guide's public [discussion space](https://github.com/CommonGuide/commonguide/discussions).
