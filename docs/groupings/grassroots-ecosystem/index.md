# Grassroots Ecosystem Agreement Starting Set

This starter set of agreements is intended for groups that aim to build community and strengthen the local human ecosystem of action. An example of this type of group is SAGE.

These agreements assume that the group:

 * Is organised by a small group (5-15 people) who host events/spaces for a larger group (20-120 people) to congregate.

 * Has organisers that are empowered to make decisions for the larger group and are interested in implementing and well-established governance policies and reviewing periodically.

 * Transparently handles operational funds

 * May be interested in becoming registered not-for-profit and/or willing to accept government grants
