# Reflexive Collectives Starter Agreements

This starter set of agreements is intended as a scaffolding process for groups seeking to co-create their governance processes and experiment with social and technical protocols that enable collective practices.

These agreements assume that the group:

    Is a dynamic collection of participant that intends to stay small enough for high-trust collective decision-making (10-40 people).

    Is interested in co-creating written protocols around collective decision-making and other ways of sharing resources and power.

    Transparently handles significant financial and material resources

    Has no plans to become a registered non-profit and seeks to avoid government-grants and corporate interests
